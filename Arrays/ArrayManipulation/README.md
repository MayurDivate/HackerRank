# HARD

Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each the array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

**Example**
- n=10
- queries = [[1,5,3], [4,8,7], [6,9,1]]

Queries are interpreted as follows:
```
    a b k
    1 5 3
    4 8 7
    6 9 1
```

Add the values of k between the indices a and b inclusive:

```
index-> 1 2 3  4  5 6 7 8 9 10
	[0,0,0, 0, 0,0,0,0,0, 0]
	[3,3,3, 3, 3,0,0,0,0, 0]
	[3,3,3,10,10,7,7,7,0, 0]
	[3,3,3,10,10,8,8,8,1, 0]
```

The largest value is 10 after all operations are performed.

**Constraints**
- 3 <= n <= 10^7
- 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5
- 1 <= a <= b <= n
- 0 <= k <= 10^9 

**Sample Input**
```
5 3
1 2 100
2 5 100
3 4 100
```
**Sample Output**
```
200
```
**Explanation**
```
After the first update the list is 100 100 0 0 0. 
After the second update list is 100 200 100 100 100. 
After the third update list is 100 200 200 200 100.
The maximum value is 200.
